Authen-OATH

This is an implementation of the HOTP and TOTP One Time Password 
algorithms as defined by OATH (http://www.openautentication.org).

Please note that some of the code was largely influenced by the 
excellent Authen::HOTP module. I modified that portion of the 
code to make it more portable and to make use of Moose. No doubt 
there are still some similarities, and I am indebted to Iain Wade 
who wrote the Authen::HOTP module.
